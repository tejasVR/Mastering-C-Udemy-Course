# Mastering-C-Udemy-Course
This is a small repository to store my exercises and solutions pertaining to the "Mastering C# Course" featured on Udemy.com. Because I am putting a lot of time into the course, I want to show that I'm still coding even though I may not necessarily be working on my direct VR projects.

## Courses I am following:

- C# Beginner Course (Completed on May 8th) : https://www.udemy.com/csharp-tutorial-for-beginners.
- C# Intermediate Course (In Progress) : https://www.udemy.com/csharp-intermediate-classes-interfaces-and-oop.
- C# Advanced Course: https://www.udemy.com/csharp-advanced/
